            SendSMS will be a blog about sending set SMS texts by running a python script. I wanted this feature and it was hard to google so I thought I could create a blog to spread the information for those that wants it (I don't have the link to the guide I used though). <br />Here's a <a href="https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/Python_Message/blob/master/sendMessage.py">link</a> of another python messaging guide that I just found. It's very well documented but it provides functions and because of that, it makes it more complicated than this blog.

And I also have to handle dealing with many blog posts so that they're not all on a single page and have to load a lot of content each time visiting. #WILL REVISIT.

            So if you are looking to make something like this, I made this website from the lessons from the <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> for free. This website is pretty much exactly the same style as one of the practicing example.

            This semester of school at Skyline College is (should be) my last semester there. Just finishing up a couple of classes before I transfer to a 4-year college. Since the classes aren't that demanding, I started learning about <strong>web design</strong>. I have to say: making your own websites is pretty fun. This is awesome.
